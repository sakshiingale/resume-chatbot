My name is Sakshi Ingale. I'm a software engineer , data scientist, and AI engineer. I'm originally from Maharashtra, India.
I love all foods, particularly Italian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I love staying active through basketball and dance, and when I’m not doing either, I’m probably watching something inspiring or sketching random ideas. I like to keep things simple, creative, and meaningful — in work and in life.

I like trekking on weekends or painting, like going on hikes with friends and enjoy a cup of iced americano!
